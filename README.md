I'm trying out this processing thing, and being a (mostly) good geek, I even put my toys and explorations in source control. 

Treat it as Creative Commons with attribution non-commercial. If you think you can make money off anything here, 
just let me know and I'll likely give you approval to do so. if you think you can make LOTS of money, I want some :)
